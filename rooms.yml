    Your first thought was, he lied in every word.
    
    The old man’s malicious eyes stare at you as if he’s 
    bursting inside at the thought of gaining a new victim. 
    He tells a story about a hidden tower, a dark tower, 
    that holds unimaginable power and must be stopped. 
    Yada yada, he goes on and on about an evil being, 
    monsters, a quest, and so on.

    Looking at the sun, you notice it’s getting late, so
    you agree to go the direction he points, grudgingly, 
    but also secretly basking in the grandiose thoughts 
    of high adventure and fame. Mostly, though, you agree 
    because you’re bored and you’re hoping for an end to 
    the boredom … the end maybe? You need something to do, 
    somewhere to go, someone to be.

    Should you follow his gaze and head out towards the town
    gates on your quest? Or, maybe it's better to simply go home?

    It's a dreary day, as you set out onto the path the old
    man pointed to. The setting sun's light is just enough
    for you to catch a sight of a wandering cat in the distance.
    
    Your mind's made up. There's no going back! As ominous
    as the cat creature crossing your path may seem, you must
    go on.

    You walk farther along the path for a while, until you
    stop and look back at the road you had followed. The
    road is no longer there, planting a seed of doubt within you.
    You look around and see nothing but grey plains all around you.

    You decide to head onwards. It is difficult to remember
    which direction you are headed in, yet you hold together,
    for now. You have never seen such desolation before, for
    you see no plants, no life, not even bugs. Even a small
    patch of grass would have been a mercy. Yet there was none
    to be had.
