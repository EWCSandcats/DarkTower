    Your first thought was, he lied in every word.
    
    The old man’s malicious eyes stare at you as if he’s 
    bursting inside at the thought of gaining a new victim. 
    He tells a story about a hidden tower, a dark tower, 
    that holds unimaginable power and must be stopped. 
    Yada yada, he goes on and on about an evil being, 
    monsters, a quest, and so on.

    Looking at the sun, you notice it’s getting late, so
    you agree to go the direction he points, grudgingly, 
    but also secretly basking in the grandiose thoughts 
    of high adventure and fame. Mostly, though, you agree 
    because you’re bored and you’re hoping for an end to 
    the boredom … the end maybe? You need something to do, 
    somewhere to go, someone to be.
